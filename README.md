# My DevOps Git Project

This project is created for DevOps practice.  
It contains a simple HTML file and Git ignore rules.


## Objective
Manage a DevOps project using Git best practices, including proper branching, commits, and pull requests.

---

## Tools Used
- **Git**
- **GitHub**

---

## Project Deliverables
- Proper Git branching structure (`main`, `dev`, and feature branches)
- Pull request workflow
- `.gitignore` file
- `README.md` documentation
- HTML sample file for testing

---

## Steps Followed

1. **Initialized Local Repository**
   
  - git init

2. Connected to GitHub Repository

  - git remote add origin <repo-url>

3. Created Branches

  - git checkout -b dev
  - git checkout -b feature/add-hello

4. Added Files

  - index.html – sample HTML page
  - .gitignore – ignored unnecessary files
  - README.md – project documentation

5. Committed Changes

 - git add .
 - git commit -m "Initial project setup"
 - git push origin feature/add-hello

6. Opened Pull Request

 - Compared feature/add-hello branch with dev branch
 - Added title & description
 - Submitted PR for review

7. Merged Pull Request

 - Merged changes into dev
 - Created Pull Request from dev to main
 - Merged into main

8. Git Commands Reference

 - git status                # Check current changes
 - git add .                 # Stage all changes
 - git commit -m "message"   # Commit staged changes
 - git push origin branch    # Push branch to remote
 - git checkout branch       # Switch branch
 - git branch                # List branches

9. Outcome

 - By completing this task, I learned:
 - How to structure branches in Git
 - How to work with feature branches
 - How to create and merge Pull Requests in GitHub
 - How to document Git workflows in a project
